Authored by Seymour M. Hersh, it documented an intelligence operation against the anti-war movement, as well as \"break-ins, wiretapping and the surreptitious inspection of mail\" conducted since the 1950s. According to former CIA Official Cord Meyer, these disclosures \"Convinced large sections of the American public that the CIA had become a domestic Gestapo and stimulated an overwhelming demand for the wide-ranging congressional investigations that were to follow.\"\\nHersh had been tipped off to the possibility of an \"in house operation\" by an unidentified member of the CIA in spring of 1974. He embarked on an investigation, speaking to sources that included CIA Chief of Counterintelligence James Angleton. Although he was not aware of its existence, Hersh uncovered much information that had been documented in the \"Family Jewels\", a report ordered by Director of Central Intelligence William Colby that chronicled CIA abuses over the past 25 years. The report would not be formally revealed to the public until 2007.\\n\\n\\n=== Monitoring of anti-war movement and Project MINARET ===\\n\\nThe article alleged that CIA agents had followed and photographed participants in the antiwar movement, as well as other demonstrations. It also reported that the CIA \"set up a network of informants who were ordered to penetrate antiwar groups\", and even placed an avowedly anti-war congressperson under surveillance while putting other lawmakers in a dossier on dissident Americans.\\nInstituted in 1967 by the NSA, Project MINARET\\'s purpose was to document \"Soviet, Chinese, and North Vietnamese influence over the militant civil rights and antiâ€“Vietnam War movements\" for the CIA and FBI, according to historian Donald Critchlow. The NSA provided CIA and FBI officials  with reports of intercepted international communications by certain individuals in these movements. NSA officials stipulated that FBI and CIA agents must destroy or return these reports within two weeks of receiving them. The NSA also required that \"the reports not be \\'identified with the National Security Agency\\' and that all records relating to this program were \\'not serialize[d]\\' or filed with other NSA records, were classified \\'Top Secret,\\' and were stamped \\'Background Use Only\\'... because the'),\n",
